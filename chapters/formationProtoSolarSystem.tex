\section{The formation of comets \& asteroids in the early solar system}
Introduction\\

\subsection{Creation of asteroids and comets}
In the Solar System, there are two main sources for asteroids and comets: the asteroid belt and the Kuiper Belt. The former is located between the terrestrial planets and the gas planets in a region that is often referred to as the snow line \cite{asteroid_belts}, while the latter is located further out than any of the known planets.\\
In the early states of the solar system, asteroids in the asteroid belt formed within the solar nebula but the gravitational forces and disturbances of Jupiter prevented the small planetesimals to form a planet. 


\subsection{Water distribution in the early states of the solar system and now - mainly referring to objects behind the frost lines}
The early states of the Solar System with its hot inner core near the proto sun have mainly contributed to the fact that the only water-rich asteroids originally came from the outer asteroid belt and the Kuiper Belt. Up to 10 percent of their mass is water. \cite{timescale}

\subsection{H/D ratio in comets and asteroids}
Summary of measurement data + theories on the H/D ratio of the solar system, focusing on objects from the (outer) asteroid belt and the Kuiper Belt.
